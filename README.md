# Block FB sponsored post

Install https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ for FF 
or https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo for chrome.

Works in polish by default, for other languages just change in line 29:
'Sponsorowane' to 'sponsored in your language'.

Use script code from file blockfb.js.
Profit!
